# makefiles ðŸš§

A guide to Makefiles. Designed for CPSC 213 at the University of British Columbia (UBC), but also hopefully more broadly applicable to other students. (I've read a lot of Makefile tutorials, and most of them are a bit confusing. So, hopefully this rendition is a bit clearly for undergraduates.) The content here is mostly just a more accessible version of [Chapter 2 of the `make` manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#toc-An-Introduction-to-Makefiles), "An Introduction to Makefiles," with some extra tidbits here and there.

Now, without further ado,

## Motivations

`make` is a command line program that, in tandem with a `Makefile`, allows one to 'compile' and 'link' small, medium, and large programs. If you've ever compiled a program, like

`gcc main.c -o main; ./main`

or perhaps

`javac Main.java; java -cp . Main`

or even

`clang++ main.cpp -o main; ./main`

you'll benefit from `make`. `make` can be used to add "shortcuts" for various common commands as well, such as cleaning up undesired files from your project. It also _only recompiles what is necessary_ which, while never particularly relevant for assignments consisting of less than 1,000 lines of code, becomes extraordinarily relevant in codebases of 1,000,000+ lines.

## Makefile Basics

Firstly, make sure you have `make` actually installed. Note this is not the same thing as `cmake`. (I'm not proud to admit it, but I thought these were equivalents for a very long time.) You should also have `gcc` working (and ideally some kind of Java installed). Again, new-to-C Windows users might have issues here; I recommend using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to fix those issues (or better yet, WSL).

> Aside: `cmake` is a meta-`make` (that is, like `make` for `make`). It builds makefiles for various systems simultaneously. It has 'profiles' for different compilers and systems, and will automatically generate the correct flags, et cetera, on the fly. In short, it's for _huge_ projects, and I won't be covering it in this guide.

To check if you have `make` installed, run `make --version`. I see `GNU Make 4.2.1 [...]` on my machine. If you see an error like,

> "'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file" (from PowerShell, on Windows.)

or

> "make": command not found (from Linux, I believe.)

you need to install the software. Follow [these](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) steps; on Windows, `choco` is your friend here.

Try running `make` with no arguments. You should see the following.

```shellscript
$ make
> make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
```

`make` is looking for a corresponding `Makefile` and didn't find one. Let's start by creating one!

Makefiles are essential a set of different commands or "rules." They have **no** file extension, and are just written in plaintext. Each rule has roughly the following structure.

```Makefile
target ...: prerequisites ...
    recipe
    ...
```

The **target** is the name of the file generated by the program. A **prerequisite** is dependency for the target, which should be another target itself. The **recipe** is the actual set of actions carried out. The target and recipe are required, but prerequisites are of course optional.

**WARNING**: Makefiles are picky about spacing, like Python. Each line in a recipe must be prefixed by a `TAB` character. Four spaces don't work; it really needs to be tabs. Just a note.

Let's go back to the basic `gcc main.c -o main` we all know and love. If you check out `examples/basic`, we can see what this looks like in a Makefile. Begin by trying

```shellscript
$ gcc main.c -o main; ./main
> H3llo, w0rld!
```

which works as normal. Now run

```shellscript
$ make; ./main
> H3llo, w0rld!
```

our first Makefile! And it's really just one line:

```Makefile
main: main.c
```

kind-of cool isn't it? Though it's a bit unorthodox, we could even do this for a Java file. Running the `examples/java` file in VS Code gave some horrible command like

```shellscript
$ /usr/bin/env /home/mdema/.sdkman/candidates/java/current/bin/java --enable-preview -XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp /home/mdema/.vscode-server/data/User/workspaceStorage/cd1681cbf16d44646f4b732fd6d07a6f/redhat.java/jdt_ws/makefiles_57addee4/bin examples.java.Main
> Hello, world!
```

Instead, try

```shellscript
$ make
> Hello, world!
```

(Forgive the `cd`s in the Makefile; this is just for demonstration.) Clearly, `make` _can_ be used to run any set of commands. Rules are at their core, just a set of instructions, a "recipe", that are just commands you would've had to run by hand in the shell.

## More on Makefiles

Oftentimes, our programs are not just single files. What if we want to compile a bunch of `.c` files and `.h` files into a single executable? This is where object files (`.o`) can truly benefit us. We can create rules to construct intermediate `.o` files, and then create a "master" rule that combines (or better yet, links) a bunch of these object files together.

In sum, the template is something like this

```Makefile
main: something.o something_else.o something_else_other.o
    gcc -o main something.o \
      something_else.o \
      something_else_other.o

something.o: something.c something.h defs.h
    gcc -c something.c

something_else.o: something_else.c defs.h
    gcc -c something_else.c

something_else_other.o: something_else_other.c constants.h defs.h
    gcc -c something_else_other.c
```

To create `main`, you would type `make` (or `make main`). Notice how `main` is just that, and not suffixed with a `.o`. We also use `-o` instead of `-c` to create an output file instead of an object file. This example nicely demonstrates the importance of prerequisites; if we edit `constants.h`, recompiling main will only recompile `something_else_other.o` before linkage, saving some computation time.

The first rule given is used by default, so it should be the "main" goal or executable produced by your program.

> A few asides from the above example. Firstly, note that `make` itself is not picky about what goes in a recipe, and it's your task as the programmer to devise a recipe that really works. Second, `gcc` is the GNU C compiler; you can see a brief guide to different compilers [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1516609/difference-between-cc-gcc-and-g). `cc` is a more generally applicable option.

It can be a bit tedious re-writing all these file names. Instead, it's common practice to throw them into a variable. The above example becomes.

```Makefile
objects = something.o something_else.o something_else_other.o

main: $(objects)
    gcc -o main $(objects)

# etc.
```

You'll also notice that we're manually stating `gcc -o main ...` in each of these, but we did not do that in our basic example. In fact, `make` has an implicit rule to use `cc -c` to compile object files from `.c` files. It's pretty nifty. Likewise, `make` also allows us to skip adding the `.c` file itself to its object file prerequisite. The above example simplifies to

```Makefile
objects = something.o something_else.o something_else_other.o

main: $(objects)
    gcc -o main $(objects)

something.o: something.h defs.h
something_else.o: defs.h
something_else_other.o: constants.h defs.h
```

Notice how `defs.h` is a pre-requisite to all of our object files? There's more room for improvement here. We can group entries by their pre-requisites instead. This yields

```Makefile
objects = something.o something_else.o something_else_other.o

main: $(objects)
    gcc -o main $(objects)

$(objects): defs.h
something.o: something.h
something_else_other.o: constants.h
```

Last thing before we wrap upâ€”running these commands will leave a lot of unwanted files hanging around. To fix this, let's add a "phony" command called `clean` that will delete junk files. The reason it is called "phony" is that we don't have a file `clean.c`, but rather we're looking to just automate some command line task.

We get

```Makefile
objects = something.o something_else.o something_else_other.o

main: $(objects)
    gcc -o main $(objects)

$(objects): defs.h
something.o: something.h
something_else_other.o: constants.h

.PHONY: clean

clean:
    rm main $(objects)
```

## Fancy Makefiles

What if we want to add some command line options to our `gcc` call? For example, running `gcc main.c -std=gnu11 -Wall -o main`? To do this, we just parameterize the `gcc` part of a recipe. Continuing our earlier example,

```Makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -I -std=gnu11 -Wall

objects = something.o something_else.o something_else_other.o

main: $(objects)
    $(CC) -o main $(objects)

# etc.
```

Notice that we must specify the `$(CC)` and the `CFLAGS` is added automatically by the compiler.

Remember the earlier example where we wanted to pull out `defs.h` from each of our pre-requisites? There's a different, arguably better way of doing this that involves using macros. We can also create "generic" rules that apply to globs (e.g., all `*.c` files). This example demonstrates this

```Makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -I -std=gnu11 -Wall

OBJECTS = something.o something_else.o something_else_other.o
DEPS = defs.h

%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS)

main: $(objects)
    $(CC) -o main $(objects)

# etc.
```

This fancy `%.o` rule says all object files depend on their respective `.c` file along with all of the `DEPS`.

For a final step, let's add directories. What if our `.h` files are in an `include/` directory, our source code lives in a `src/` folder, we have local libraries in a `lib/` folder, and we want to stuff our object files into an output directory. Here's what that would look like.

```Makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -I $(IDIR) -std=gnu11 -Wall

IDIR = ../include
ODIR = obj
LDIR = ../lib

LIBS = -lm

_DEPS = main.h
DEPS = $(patsubst %, $(IDIR)/%, $(_DEPS))

_OBJ = main.o other.o
OBJ = $(patsubst %, $(ODIR)/%, $(_OBJ))


$(ODIR)/%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
    $(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

main: $(OBJ)
    $(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)

.PHONY: clean

clean: # core is for core dumps!
    rm -f $(ODIR)/*.o *~ core $(IDIR)/*~
```

There are a few extra oddities in this snippet. There are a few [automatic variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables) being used. `$@` is the name specified on the left of the colon. `$<` is the first item in the dependencies list. `$^` is the names of all of the pre-requisites.

`patsubst` is a helper function to replace words matching a specified pattern with some text. "%" acts as a wildcard character.

With the above information and the knowledge in the rest of this guide, try to break down what happens above for yourself as an exercise!

## Glossary

- **compile**, meaning to transform source code into object files (e.g. running `gcc main.c`)
- **executable file**, a file that when run causes a computer to perform a set of instructions (e.g., the `main` in `gcc main.c -o main`)
- **link**, meaning to transform many object files (i.e., the things made in compilation) into a single executable file
- **machine code**, a (super) low-level programming language that controls a CPU
- **object files**, a file that contain object code, which is machine code that is output from a compiler or assembler (e.g., our `.o` files); they cannot be run in the command line
